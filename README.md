Password validation; checks that a password meets your defined requirements.

![example1.png](./doc/example1.png)

### node_inputs

Send a message string with the value you want to validate.

### node_outputs

Outputs a message object with the value of your input and if it is valid. If not valid will also list an array of the failed checks

### Name

Define the msg name if you wish to change the name displayed on the node.

### digits

The number of digits, as an integer, the message string must contain to be valid.<br><u>Example:</u> A value of 2 requires that the message has two integers in its string to be valid. A value of 0 requires that the message has no integers in its string to be valid. Leaving the field empty/blank will ignore the validation check, so you can have as many or none in the message string as you want.

### letters

The number of letters, as an integer, the message string must contain to be valid.<br><u>Example:</u> A value of 2 requires that the message has two integers in its string to be valid. A value of 0 requires that the message has no integers in its string to be valid. Leaving the field empty/blank will ignore the validation check, so you can have as many or none in the message string as you want.

### lowercase

The number of lowercase, as an integer, the message string must contain to be valid.<br><u>Example:</u> A value of 2 requires that the message has two integers in its string to be valid. A value of 0 requires that the message has no integers in its string to be valid. Leaving the field empty/blank will ignore the validation check, so you can have as many or none in the message string as you want.

### uppercase

The number of uppercase, as an integer, the message string must contain to be valid.<br><u>Example:</u> A value of 2 requires that the message has two integers in its string to be valid. A value of 0 requires that the message has no integers in its string to be valid. Leaving the field empty/blank will ignore the validation check, so you can have as many or none in the message string as you want.

### symbols

The number of symbols, as an integer, the message string must contain to be valid.<br><u>Example:</u> A value of 2 requires that the message has two integers in its string to be valid. A value of 0 requires that the message has no integers in its string to be valid. Leaving the field empty/blank will ignore the validation check, so you can have as many or none in the message string as you want.

### spaces

The number of spaces, as an integer, the message string must contain to be valid.<br><u>Example:</u> A value of 2 requires that the message has two integers in its string to be valid. A value of 0 requires that the message has no integers in its string to be valid. Leaving the field empty/blank will ignore the validation check, so you can have as many or none in the message string as you want.

### min

The minimum length of the string, as an integer, the message string length must be to be valid.<br><u>Example:</u> A value of 8 requires that the message length must be at least 8 to be valid. Leaving the field empty/blank will ignore the validation check, so you can have as short of a message string as you want.

### max

The maximum length of the string, as an integer, the message string length must be to be valid.<br><u>Example:</u> A value of 10 requires that the message cant be any longer than 10 to be valid. Leaving the field empty/blank will ignore the validation check, so you can have as long of a message string as you want.
